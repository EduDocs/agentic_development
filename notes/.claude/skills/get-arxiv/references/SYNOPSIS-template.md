# SYNOPSIS.md template — discovery reading note

Fill this in and write it as `SYNOPSIS.md` at the root of `resources/arXiv-<id>v<ver>/`.
The purpose is **discovery**: a future agent (or the PI) reads this to decide whether and how
the paper is relevant to the manuscript in progress. Pull title/authors/abstract from the
arXiv Atom API (`http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=<id>`) for accuracy. Model the
tone and depth on `~/ClaudeAMP/arXiv-2402.08676v1/SUMMARY.md`.

Keep the reading-note disclaimer when the PI is **not** an author. Make the
"Relevance to the manuscript" section concrete — point at real `sections/*.tex` files.

Open the file with a **YAML frontmatter block** — a lightweight provenance header for
consistency with `diff-arxiv`'s `ANALYSIS.md`. It is paper-only: `skill: get-arxiv`,
`arxiv: <id>v<ver>`, `doi: 10.48550/arXiv.<id>`, `generated: <today>`, plus the
catalog-triage fields `title`, `year`, and `tags`. It carries **no** `manuscript_commit` —
a summary describes the (immutable) paper, so it cannot go stale against the manuscript the
way an analysis does.

The header is the **source of truth** for the catalog row: `title`/`year`/`tags` here are what
`get-arxiv` copies into `resources/CATALOG.md`. Keep `tags` to a few lowercase topic words and
**reuse existing tags** across papers (a controlled vocabulary) so the catalog filters cleanly.
